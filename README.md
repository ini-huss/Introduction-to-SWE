Lab Report: Introduction to Software Engineering (Git & GitHub)
Introduction:
Version control is a fundamental practice in software engineering, enabling teams to collaborate effectively, track changes, and maintain project integrity. Git, a distributed version control system, and GitHub, a cloud-based collaboration platform, are widely used in both academia and industry. This lab provided hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, focusing on repository creation, branching, collaboration, and conflict resolution.


 Objectives 

By the end of this lab, students were expected to:


Objectives:
We were expected to:-

• Configure Git with user credentials.
• Create and manage repositories on GitHub.
• Understand and apply branching and merging strategies.
• Collaborate using pull requests and reviews.
• Resolve merge conflicts effectively.
• Reflect on the role of version control in software engineering practice.

 Methodology:
The lab was conducted in sequential steps:

1. Git Setup
• Installed Git and configured username/email.
• Verified installation with git --version.

2. Repository Creation
• Initialized a local repository using git init.
• Created a remote repository on GitHub and linked it via git remote add origin.

3. Branching and Commits
• Created new branches (git branch feature-x).
• Staged and committed changes (git add, git commit).
• Pushed branches to GitHub (git push origin feature-x).

4. Collaboration via Pull Requests
• Opened pull requests on GitHub.
• Reviewed and merged contributions.

5. Conflict Resolution
• Simulated conflicting edits.
• Used Git’s merge tools to resolve conflicts.
• Documented the resolution process.
6. Results
• Successfully configured Git and created repositories.
• Demonstrated branching and merging workflows.
• Collaborated through GitHub pull requests.
• Resolved merge conflicts, gaining practical insight into teamwork challenges.

Analysis:
The lab highlighted the importance of version control in collaborative environments. Conflict resolution illustrated how Git enforces accountability and transparency, ensuring that all changes are traceable. Branching strategies reinforced the value of modular development, allowing parallel work without disrupting the main project.

 Conclusion:
This lab provided foundational skills in Git and GitHub, essential for modern software engineering. Beyond technical commands, the exercise emphasized teamwork, communication, and structured collaboration. These practices are directly applicable to industry workflows, where version control underpins continuous integration, deployment, and long-term project sustainability.

 Reflection:
The most valuable lesson was learning to embrace conflicts as opportunities for clarity. Resolving merge conflicts required careful review and communication, mirroring real-world teamwork. This reinforced the idea that software engineering is not only about writing code but also about managing collaboration and ensuring project integrity.
